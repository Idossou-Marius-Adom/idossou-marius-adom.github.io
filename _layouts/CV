             Inputs delays, firm dynamics and misallocation in Sub-Saharan Africa </a> (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/immoschott/"> Immo Schott</a>)

          <p align="justify"> <b>Abstract:</b> We quantitatively analyze the macroeconomic consequences of border delays in Sub-Saharan Africa. Delays in imported capital 
             goods lower aggregate output through factor misallocation and an insufficient number of firms that use foreign capital in production. Our model economy 
             features heterogeneous firms that endogenously differ in the degree to which foreign capital goods are used. The model is calibrated to micro-level data 
             from Sub-Saharan Africa. We find that the existing delays are akin to a 37% tax on imported capital goods. Reducing border delays can increase aggregate 
             output by up to 14%. The gains are mainly due to a reallocation of economic activity towards more productive firms.</p>

             Time Delays at the Borders: Macroeconomic Consequences for Sub-Saharan African Economies </a> (Submitted) </p>
      
          <p align="justify"> <b>Abstract:</b> Time delays to clear imported inputs are longer in Sub-Saharan African countries than in advanced economies. In some 
             countries, the average clearance delay exceeds a month while it is about five days or less in Germany, Greece, Ireland or Thailand. This paper argues 
             that these delays generate input disruptions in Sub-Saharan Africa and quantifies their effects. To this end I develop a dynamic general equilibrium model
             where firms' foreign inputs are subject to random time delays. After calibrating the model to the data, I simulate a scenario where the average border 
             delay is reduced to one week or less. I found that firms place higher foreign input orders in the baseline model to self-insure against <i> ex-ante risk </i>
             of input disruptions. However, aggregate foreign input is lower in steady state due to <i> ex-post realizations </i> of the delays. In the counterfactual, eliminating
             the delays induces aggregate output to increase by up to 10% and employment by up to 5.8%. These gains are driven mainly by a substantial increase of 
             foreign inputs use.</p>

              <p> <b> Informality as a stepping stone in developing countries: the role of financial constraints</b> </p>
      
          <p align="justify"> <b>Abstract:</b> The macro development literature on informality in developing countries overlooked transition from informality to 
             formality. Using the World Bank Enterprise Surveys data, I document that an important proportion of formal firms in Nigeria where informal at start and 
             transited to formality later on. Further empirarical analysis show that the proportion of once-informal firms among formal firms is positively related to 
             profit tax, financial constraint and tax administration hurdles. Then I develop a structural dynamic general equilibrium model of heterogeneous firms that
             accounts for the differences between informal and formal firms at start, and for transition from informality to formality. In the model, firms face 
             financial constraints in the form of collateral requirement. I calibrate the model to Nigeria’s data and use it to assess the potential of different 
             policies to affect not only informality at start, but also transition from informality to formality. These include: i) revenue tax reduction, ii) payroll 
             tax reduction, iii) registration cost reduction, iv) better access to financial market for formal firms, v) better acces to finance for informal firms and
             entrepreneurial skills training provision. All mentioned policies are expected to reduce informality at start, but also to favor transition of some firms 
             from informality to formality. Thus, the paper emphasises that reducing the tax burden of the formal firms, and promoting financial market access to 
             entrepreneurs are policy lines that can help developing countries to tackle the informality issue.</p>

             Economic integration and synchronization of growth cycles in the WAEMU zone: a dynamic panel approach </a> (with Cheikh Tidiane Ndiaye  and Papa Daouda

          <p align="justify"> <b>Abstract:</b> The purpose of this article is to find out how the degree of synchronization of real growth cycles in WAEMU is changing 
             and to what extent does economic integration impact this synchronization. To answer these questions we introduced a new measurement approach and a dynamic
             panel type modeling estimated by the two-step conditional generalized moments method proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991) ; Bover and Blundell (1998). Our
             empirical analyzes have shown that the interrelationships between the UEMOA economies in terms of trade are very limited. Nevertheless, the bilateral 
             synchronization of cycles, although weak, evolves since 2006. According to our empirical investigations, in sum, we can say that the results obtained 
             suggest that the key determinants of the synchronization of the economic growth cycles in the UEMOA are the synchronization of the previous period, 
             differences in production patterns, differences in inflation, and common external shocks.</p>

             A model of simultaneous equations in panel data is developed to compensate for the endogeneity and simultaneity of the variables, and whose estimation 
             is performed by the two-stage least squares techniques using instrumental variables. In addition, a composite social welfare indicator was constructed on 
             which the impacts of migrants’ transfers of funds were assessed. The results indicate that financial development is the main channel for indirect 
             transmission of the effects of migrant transfers on economic growth. However, we did not detect a direct effect in one direction or the other between 
             growth and transfers. Nonetheless, they have positive and very significant impacts on the welfare of the population. Also, the democratic variables 
             introduced into the models impact positively economic growth and the standard of living in the WAEMU zone. </p>

             Analysis of the Impacts of Exchange Rate Variations on the Benin Economy: The Case of the FCFA and the Naira </a> (with Rémy Hounsou and Ahassane Camara). 
             International Journal of Management Sciences and Business Research, July-2017 ISSN (2226-8235) Vol-6, Issue 7. </p>
      
          <p align="justify"> <b>Abstract:</b> Benin shares with Nigeria, about 773 kilometers of land border. The two countries are linked by very long sociocultural 
             and historical relationships. Beyond these affinities, their geographical proximity allows them to trade based on their economic disparities. Consequently,
             Nigeria's economic shocks have repercussions on Benin, in this case those of its currency. In particular, the decision of the Central Bank of Nigeria in 
             June 2016 to let the exchange rate of the currency fluctuate freely has seriously affected the Beninese economy. This study assesses the impacts of a 
             variation in the exchange rate between the CFA and the Naira on Benin using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Thus, we were able to prospect 
             the probable impacts of a common currency (ie a unit exchange rate) for Benin and Nigeria. Our results showed that the known decline in naira prices in 
             June 2016 compared to 2010 had a negative and severe effect on government revenues, which declined by 19.6% for export taxes and 14.4% for internal market
             taxes (including imports). Similarly, the decline resulted in a sharp decline in inflation of 14% and nominal GDP of 12.4%, while real GDP rose by 2.2%. 
             Consumption fell by 12.3% at 13.8% for rural households as against 10.9% for urban households. Thus, the depreciation of the Naira is proving to be a 
             source of deepening inequality in Benin. This decline in Naira prices also affects employment and drives the economy towards trade and services to the 
             detriment of productive sectors such as agriculture and industry. It penalizes unskilled workers while skilled workers take refuge in the administration. 
             We conclude that overall, Benin is favored by a strong Naira rather than a weak Naira. In particular, a common currency scenario is not favorable for 
             Benin.</p> -->

       <!-- <p align="justify"> West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries are capital market integrated and design jointly their fiscal and monetary policies. 
          This paper offers a quantitative analysis of the fiscal rule in this economic and monetary union and characterizes an optimal reforms. The theoretical framework used is a model 
          of fiscal policy where present-biased governments face shocks to their fiscal needs. The structure of the model implies a trade-off between flexibility for the government to
          react to shocks and commitment to limit its incentives to overborrow. I documented a significant heterogeneity in government revenue, spending, and debt across WAEMU countries. 
          I found that the current uniform 3% deficit rule improves the citizens' welfare of all WAEMU countries compared to full discretion. However, country-specific fiscal rules
          would be Pareto improving reform over the current uniform rule either when the governments individually design their rules or when a central authority jointly designs
          the rules for the governments. Each country's optimal deficit limit level is influenced by the volatility of the shocks on it government revenues and
          the level of the present-bias  of the government.</p> -->

         <!-- <p align="justify"> We develop a method that can give insights to researchers to better specify their quantitative models in international business cycles studies. The
     guidance comes from the application of accounting procedure that is base on prototype model of international growth model including wedges that captures all the 
     eventual frictions and distortions of markets. For each country, we include -efficiency wedge, labor wedge, investment wedge, government wedge, preference wedge
     and foreign asset wedge. We then demonstrate the method by applying to US and Canada during the Great recession (2007-2008). We found that the economic downturns 
     in both countries during this period is primary due to US investment wedge, US labor wedge, US efficiency wedge and secondary is due to Canada investment wedge. 
     Those results suggest that the crisis has started in US and has propagated to Canada.  </p>  -->
